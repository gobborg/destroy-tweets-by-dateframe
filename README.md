A Python script to mass-delete your tweets based on a specified dateframe.

You need the archive of your tweets as a json file.
Datetime is terrible as always.
You can delete all of your tweets between two dates, before one date, or after one date.

You need twitter developer keys. I set mine up as a standalone app.

This code contains counters for how many tweets were successfully deleted, failed to delete (perhaps you deleted them since downloading the archive), and unaffected tweets. The counts are not stored.
